# Codex Notes

- Codex panel is set to "Agent (full access)" to avoid write prompts while working on this
  repo.
- Full access removes the prior approvals required for file writes; use with care when
  making changes.
- If prompts return, check the mode selector at the bottom of the Codex panel and switch
  back to "Agent (full access)".
