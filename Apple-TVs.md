# Apple TVs

I have six Apple TVs:

- **TV 1** - **TV 4**, connected to my living room TV, used with my
  [multiviewer](https://github.com/sweeks/multiviewer).

- **Art TV**, connected to a TV over my fireplace, running ArtCast.

- **Guest TV**, connected to a TV on the wall in my guest room.

My ATVs are Apple TV 4k (3rd generation), running tvOS 26.2 as of 2026-01.

All my ATVs are connected to my home ethernet, except for Art TV, which is connected to my
home WiFi.

## Taking a screenshot

To take a screenshot of an Apple TV, start Xcode on my Mac, open
`Window > Devices and Simulators`, and then select the desired ATV in the sidebar (pair if
needed).
